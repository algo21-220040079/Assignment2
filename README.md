## Main idea
The China Securities Regulatory Commission approved the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and established an interconnection mechanism for the mainland and Hong Kong stock markets. The market usually refers to the combined inflow of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect as northbound funds. In other words, the capital going north refers to the capital flowing into the mainland stock market from Hong Kong, while the capital flowing into the Hong Kong stock market from the mainland is called the capital going south. The market widely believes that northbound funds are "smart money", which will have a certain indication effect on the short-term trend of the market. Therefore, my assignment conducts a statistical analysis of this indicator, construct a stock market timing strategy based on northbound funds, and conduct historical backtests. The results show that northbound funds have a good predictive effect on judging the rise and fall of the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index.
